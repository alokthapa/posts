	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever you post a comment in a blog, news article or your favorite social network, there is always a question of who owns the data and who creates value.  Clearly on sites like Facebook and Twitter, YOU create most of the value, with comment on NYTimes, you create partial value. However you run the risk of losing YOUR data if the company goes under or it gets bought by Google and is discontinued.  That's where disqus comes in and at least tries to solve the problem. If the website you're on supports disqus, then you have some control over your data. However this only solves the problem partially since for all the sites that don't support disqus comments,  the problem still persists.</p>
<p>The solution:</p>
<p>A browser extension that records whatever you type on a textbox. ( Of course you have to authorize it to do so). That way all your comments are safe. It could also provide an option to save it on a server somewhere so you have some kind of a stream/blog kinda thing that belongs to you.</p>
<p>I hope somebody builds this. I'd use it.</p>]]></content:encoded>
