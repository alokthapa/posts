<div class='post_body'><p>Some updates on the callbreak and satori applications. I have finally gotten around to setting up my ec2 server and now callbreak (Seaside version ) and the Satori (github.com/alokthapa/satori) are both available online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Link to callbreak : bit.ly/playcallbreak</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Link to satori:&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/f5BIrk">http://bit.ly/f5BIrk</a> (although this seems to be broken right now... :( )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I've been working on a scheme implementation for flush (or sth like that), which is played using 3 cards. It's available here at github.com/alokthapa/flush so download it and check it out. You will need Racket 5.1 to play the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p></div>
